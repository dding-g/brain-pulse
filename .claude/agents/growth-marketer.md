2. Mini-game in action (Speed Match)
3. Share card example ("Top 5%!")
4. Streak calendar with daily scores

## Viral Loop Design

```
User plays -> Gets score -> Sees share card ->
Shares to SNS -> Friend sees card ->
"What's my brain score?" -> Downloads app ->
Plays -> Gets score -> Shares...
```

### K-Factor Optimization

```
K = invitations_sent × conversion_rate
Target K > 0.3

Levers:
- Share card attractiveness (design iteration)
- Share friction reduction (1-tap share)
- Landing page conversion (smart app banner)
- Curiosity gap ("What's YOUR brain score?")
```
